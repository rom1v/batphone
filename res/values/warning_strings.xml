This software is a DEVELOPER PROTOTYPE release to help community
developers to help us to improve this software.
\n\n
It is NOT INTENDED FOR PUBLIC USE.  It has LOTS OF BUGS. It might
FLATTEN YOUR BATTERY or INTERFERE WITH NORMAL OPERATION of your phone.
\n\n
It is NOT FIT FOR MERCHANTABILITY FOR ANY PURPOSE and CARRIES NO
WARRANTY, IMPLIED OR OTHERWISE.
\n\n
It is however loads of fun to use to discover the potential of free
and open mesh telephony.
\n\n
If you are not a developer, you are of course welcome to try it out,
and let us know of any problems you find, and that would be great. But
please do not rely on it at this time, and certainly dont use it to
replace any reliable means of communication.
