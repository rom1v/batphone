<h2 id="releasenotesforservalmesh0.90shiny">Release Notes for Serval Mesh 0.90 “Shiny”</h2>

<div><a href="http://www.servalproject.org/">Serval Project</a>, January 2013</div>

<div>These notes accompany the release in January 2013 of version 0.90 (codename
“Shiny”) of the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.servalproject">Serval Mesh</a> app for <a href="http://developer.android.com/about/versions/android-2.2-highlights.html">Android 2.2 “Froyo”</a> and above.</div>

<div>This release succeeds <a href="./doc/RELEASE-0.08.md">version 0.08</a> that was released in June 2012.</div>

<h2 id="whatisservalmesh">What is Serval Mesh?</h2>

<div>Serval Mesh is an app for <a href="http://developer.android.com/about/versions/android-2.2-highlights.html">Android 2.2 “Froyo”</a> and above. It provides free,
secure phone-to-phone voice calling, SMS and file sharing over <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi">Wi-Fi</a>,
without the need for a SIM card or a commercial mobile telephone carrier. In
other words, it lets your Android phone call other Android phones running
Serval Mesh within Wi-Fi range.</div>

<div>The <a href="./PRIVACY.md">Serval Mesh Privacy Policy</a> describes how Serval Mesh handles your
personal and other sensitive information.</div>

<!--<div>The <a href="TBC">Serval Mesh 0.90 User&#8217;s Manual</a> contains instructions for using
Serval Mesh.</div><-->

<h2 id="warnings">Warnings</h2>

<div>Serval Mesh version 0.90 is <strong>EXPERIMENTAL SOFTWARE</strong>. It has not yet reached
version 1.0, and is intended for pre-production, demonstration purposes only.
It may not work as advertised, it may lose or alter messages and files that it
carries, it may consume a lot of space, speed and battery, and it may crash
unexpectedly.</div>

<div>Serval Mesh requests <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_rooting">root permission</a> (super-user) on your Android device in
order to put Wi-Fi into <a href="http://compnetworking.about.com/cs/wirelessfaqs/f/adhocwireless.htm">Ad-Hoc mode</a>. If you grant super-user permission to
Serval Mesh, then it will take control of your device&#8217;s Wi-Fi and use it to
contact other Serval Mesh devices in the vicinity. <strong>This will cut off normal
Wi-Fi network access.</strong></div>

<div>If your device has no root access or if you deny super-user permission to
Serval Mesh, or if no other Ad-Hoc mode devices are nearby, then Serval Mesh
will revert to using Wi-Fi in the normal Client mode. This should not
interrupt conventional network access, but it could do so. If there is no
nearby access point like a home Wi-Fi router or public hot-spot then Serval
Mesh will put your device&#8217;s Wi-Fi into <a href="http://compnetworking.about.com/cs/wireless/g/bldef_ap.htm">Access Point mode</a> (turn on personal
hotspot). <strong>This will give nearby devices access to your mobile data plan, and
COULD COST YOU MONEY.</strong></div>

<div>Serval Mesh telephony is a “best effort” service, primarily intended for when
conventional telephony is not possible or cost effective, and <strong>MUST NOT BE
RELIED UPON</strong> for emergencies in place of carrier-grade communications systems.
The Serval Project cannot be held responsible for any performance or
non-performance of the technologies that they provide in good will, and if you
use these technologies you must agree to indemnify the Serval Project from any
such claims.</div>

<div>The Serval Mesh software copies all files shared using the Rhizome file
distribution service to other phones and devices running the Serval Mesh
software, regardless of size, content or intended recipient. The Serval
Project cannot be held responsible for the legality or propriety of any files
received via Rhizome, nor for any loss, damage or offence caused by the
transmission or receipt of any content via Rhizome.</div>

<div>See the disclaimers below.</div>

<h2 id="whatsnewsince0.08">What&#8217;s new since 0.08</h2>

</ul>

<div>There have been enormous changes under the hood since 0.08:</div>

<ul>
<li><div>The foundations of the <a href="https://github.com/servalproject/serval-docs/blob/master/serval-security-framework/ServalSecurityFramework.odt">Serval Security Framework</a> are now in place.
 <a href="http://nacl.cr.yp.to/">Elliptic curve cryptography</a> is used for identifying, protecting and
 authenticating subscribers and mesh network traffic.</div></li>
<li><div>All Serval-to-Serval traffic (except Rhizome transfers) is now encapsulated
 in Serval&#8217;s new, secure <a href="http://developer.servalproject.org/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=content:technologies:mdp">Mesh Datagram Protocol</a>, implemented as an
 overlay network on standard <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol">IP</a> over <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi">Wi-Fi</a>.</div></li>
<li><div>The original Java implementation of the <a href="http://developer.servalproject.org/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=content:technologies:rhizome">Rhizome</a> file sharing system has
 been superseded by a new implementation in C within the <a href="https://github.com/servalproject/serval-dna">serval-dna</a>
 component, using <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/">SQLite</a> as the local storage engine.</div></li>
<li><div>Voice calls are now carried over the mesh using Serval&#8217;s own <a href="http://developer.servalproject.org/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=content:technologies:vomp">Voice over
 Mesh Protocol</a>, which has been designed to replace <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_Initiation_Protocol">SIP</a> and
 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_Transport_Protocol">RTP</a>. As a result, call quality and latency have improved.</div></li>
<li><div><a href="http://developer.servalproject.org/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=content:technologies:meshms">MeshMS</a> (Serval&#8217;s SMS-like service) now uses <a href="http://developer.servalproject.org/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=content:technologies:rhizome">Rhizome</a> as its transport.</div></li>
<li><div>Improved stability and responsiveness.</div></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="supporteddevices">Supported Devices</h2>

<div>This release of Serval Mesh has been extensively used and tested on the
following devices with no problems:</div>

<ul>
<li><div><strong>Huawei IDEOS X1 u8180</strong>, running Android 2.2.2 (rooted) and CyanogenMod 2.3.7</div></li>
<li><div><strong>HTC Sensation</strong>, running Android 2.3.4 (rooted) and HTC Sense 3.0</div></li>
<li><div><strong>HTC One S</strong></div></li>
<li><div><strong>Motorola Milestone</strong></div></li>
</ul>

<div>Prior releases of Serval Mesh are known to work on the following devices, which
is a strong indication that this release may also work:</div>

<ul>
<li><div><strong>Huawei IDEOS u8150</strong></div></li>
<li><div><strong>Samsung Galaxy Tab 7 inch</strong></div></li>
<li><div><strong>Samsung Galaxy Gio S5660</strong>, running Android 2.3.6 (rooted)</div></li>
<li><div><strong>Samsung Vitality SCH-R720</strong></div></li>
<li><div><strong>ZTE Score X500</strong></div></li>
<li><div><strong>HTC/Google G1</strong> (“Dream”)</div></li>
</ul>

<div>This release of Serval Mesh is known to work on the following devices with
minor problems:</div>

<ul>
<li><div><strong>Samsung Galaxy S2 GT-I9100</strong>, running Android 2.3 (rooted): Ad-Hoc Wi-Fi is
 not completely compatible with the Ad-Hoc Wi-Fi on other devices,
 specifically the Huawei IDEOS phones listed above. If the Galaxy S2 is the
 first device to join the mesh, then IDEOS phones cannot join. However, if
 an IDEOS phone is the first device, then the Galaxy S2 <em>does</em> join okay.</div></li>
<li><div><strong>Google Nexus 1</strong>: does not interoperate well with HTC/Google G1.</div></li>
</ul>

<div>The following devices have major known problems in this or prior releases:</div>

<ul>
<li><div>HTC Wildfire A3335</div></li>
<li><div>Samsung Galaxy Nexus: Wi-Fi Ad-Hoc mode does not start; Wi-Fi mode reverts
 to Off.</div></li>
<li><div>Motorola Razr i XT890: Wi-Fi control does not work.</div></li>
<li><div>Samsung Galaxy Note 2: does not detect peers. Possibly the same problem
 as the Galaxy S2 described above, but not tested.</div></li>
</ul>

<div>See the <a href="http://developer.servalproject.org/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=content:hardware:devices">Mobile Device Compatability Table</a> for more details and devices.</div>

<h2 id="knownissues">Known Issues</h2>

<div>The following issues are planned to be fixed by version 1.0:</div>

<ul>
<li><div>Poor support for multi-hop mesh calls &#8211; see <a href="https://github.com/servalproject/serval-dna/issues/37">serval-dna issue #37</a>. You
 can successfully call someone who is within Wi-Fi range of your phone, but
 calls that need to be carried through intermediate phones are unreliable.</div></li>
<li><div>Rhizome slowly and gradually consumes all space on your SD Card as you send
 and receive files &#8211; see <a href="https://github.com/servalproject/batphone/issues/8">batphone issue #8</a> and <a href="https://github.com/servalproject/serval-dna/issues/10">serval-dna issue #10</a>.
 You can work around this by deleting the Rhizome database while the Serval
 Mesh app is not running, or by re-installing the Serval Mesh app. To delete
 the database, use the <a href="http://developer.android.com/tools/help/adb.html">adb shell</a> command:</div>

<em>rm -r /sdcard/Android/data/org.servalproject/files/rhizome
</em><br></li>
<li><div>Mesh call quality degrades whenever Rhizome file or MeshMS transfers are in
 progress &#8211; see <a href="https://github.com/servalproject/serval-dna/issues/1">serval-dna issue #1</a>.</div></li>
<li><div>The Serval Mesh app works best with Android <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_rooting">root permission</a>, because it
 depends on Wi-Fi <a href="http://compnetworking.about.com/cs/wirelessfaqs/f/adhocwireless.htm">Ad-Hoc mode</a> which can only be started with root
 permision &#8211; see <a href="https://github.com/servalproject/batphone/issues/47">batphone issue #47</a>.</div></li>
<li><div>Voice call quality is unstable and relatively untested. The inefficient
 codec used by VoMP consumes more bandwidth than necessary. There is no echo
 cancellation, so echo may have to be controlled by lowering speaker volume
 or using earphones. Audio latency (delay) might exceed one second in some
 situations.</div></li>
<li><div>Every time a new MeshMS message is added to a thread, the size of the
 message transmitted by Rhizome increases, because it re-transmits all the
 prior messages in the same thread. So every message thread will consume
 more network bandwidth and SD Card space as it grows &#8211; see [serval-dna
 issue #28][]. This can be worked around by deleting the Rhizome database as
 described above.</div></li>
<li><div>After using the &#8220;Unshare&#8221; button on a Rhizome file, it does not disappear
 from the Rhizome file list &#8211; see <a href="https://github.com/servalproject/batphone/issues/53">batphone issue #53</a>. Work around:
 close the list (Back control) and re-open it (&#8220;Find&#8221; button).</div></li>
</ul>

<a href="https://github.com/servalproject/batphone/issues">batphone issues</a> and <a href="https://github.com/servalproject/serval-dna/issues">serval-dna issues</a>.</div>
